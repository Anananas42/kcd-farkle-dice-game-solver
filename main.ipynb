    "## Core Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a two-player dice game with following mechanics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given:**\n",
    "- 6 dice, each with values 1-6\n",
    "- Set of scoring combinations C, where:\n",
    "  * Single die combinations:\n",
    "    - Single 1: 100 points\n",
    "    - Single 5: 50 points\n",
    "  * Three of a kind:\n",
    "    - Three 1s: 1000 points\n",
    "    - Three 2s: 200 points\n",
    "    - Three 3s: 300 points\n",
    "    - Three 4s: 400 points\n",
    "    - Three 5s: 500 points\n",
    "    - Three 6s: 600 points\n",
    "  * Additional dice after three of a kind:\n",
    "    - Four of a kind: 2× base value\n",
    "    - Five of a kind: 4× base value\n",
    "    - Six of a kind: 8× base value\n",
    "  * Sequences:\n",
    "    - 1-5: 500 points\n",
    "    - 2-6: 750 points\n",
    "    - Six consecutive numbers: 1500 points\n",
    "- On each turn:\n",
    "  1. Roll available dice\n",
    "  2. If no valid scoring combination exists, turn ends with 0 points\n",
    "  3. If valid combination exists, player must either:\n",
    "     - Select one combination, set aside those dice, continue rolling with remainder\n",
    "     - End turn and collect accumulated points\n",
    "  4. If all dice are used, gain back all 6 dice\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to find a strategy maximizing the likelihood of victory against an opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Problem P₀: Single Turn Expected Value\n",
    "- Uniform probability distribution\n",
    "- No cycling (ignore regaining dice)\n",
    "- Maximize expected value\n",
    "- Pure tree evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### P₁: Add Cycling\n",
    "- Add state transition: empty → 6 dice\n",
    "- Introduces dependency cycle in state values\n",
    "- Reference state (6 dice) determines other state values\n",
    "\n",
    "### P₂: Points to Win\n",
    "- Replace EV with probability distribution of outcomes\n",
    "- Optimize for expected number of turns until win\n",
    "- Changes cycling evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "### P₃: Two Player\n",
    "- Add opponent's points to win\n",
    "- Both players use same optimal strategy\n",
    "- Maximize probability of winning before opponent\n",
    "\n",
    "### P₄: Non-uniform Dice\n",
    "- Different probability distribution for each die\n",
    "- Dice become non-fungible\n",
    "- Increases state space complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Space Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For each problem variant:\n",
    "\n",
    "**P₀ State:**\n",
    "- Current dice combination\n",
    "- Points accumulated this turn\n",
    "\n",
    "**P₁ State:**\n",
    "- Adds cycling reference to 6-dice state\n",
    "\n",
    "**P₂ State:**\n",
    "- Dice combination\n",
    "- Accumulated points\n",
    "- Points needed to win\n",
    "\n",
    "**P₃ State:**\n",
    "- Dice combination\n",
    "- Accumulated points\n",
    "- Own points to win\n",
    "- Opponent points to win\n",
    "\n",
    "**P₄ State:**\n",
    "- Individual die probabilities\n",
    "- Rest same as P₃\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Approach Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The decomposition allows exploring each complexity layer independently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. P₀ requires pure expected value calculation\n",
    "2. P₁ introduces fixed point computation challenge\n",
    "3. P₂ transforms from EV to probability distributions\n",
    "4. P₃ adds game theory considerations\n",
    "5. P₄ expands state space\n",
    "\n",
    "Key questions per level:\n",
    "- P₀: Can we solve analytically?\n",
    "- P₁: Is there a closed form for cyclic dependencies?\n",
    "- P₂: How to efficiently represent/compute outcome distributions?\n",
    "- P₃: How does optimal play change with opponent consideration?\n",
    "- P₄: Can we reduce expanded state space?"
